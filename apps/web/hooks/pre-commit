# Pre-commit Hook
# 
# This hook runs before code is committed to the repository. You can add
# custom checks here such as:
# - Linting (npm run lint)
# - Formatting checks
# - Unit tests
# - Type checking
#
# To install this hook, run:
#   cp hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
#   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
#
# Or use git config to set the hooks path:
#   git config core.hooksPath hooks

# Add your pre-commit checks here
